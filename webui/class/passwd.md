!['Passwords' Tab](../../.gitbook/assets/doc/users/passwords_tab.png)

### Notes on Passwords

* For a password to apply to an account, the username entered must match 
a username in the *Access Entries* tab and only password entries that are 
enabled will apply.

* You can have multiple passwords matching a single *Access Entry* if you 
wish.

* You can enter whatever you like in the comment field.

* Wildcard (anonymous) accounts don't actually need a password, but it's 
recommended you add one anyway (enter an asterisk `*`).

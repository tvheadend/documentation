# About

Tvheadend documentation is authored and maintained by Tvheadend users. If you see something is incorrect or missing please click the GitBook link below to join our documentation team. The GitBook online app makes changing documentation simple, with changes sent directly to our documentation repo on GitHub as a pull-request that project staff can review and merge.

{% hint style="info" %}
English language skills are not important for contributions! - It is easier for a native speaker to merge changes and then make edits/corrections than to write everything themselves. If you are unsure where to place content in the current documentation structure please use the [WIP](broken-reference) section - we will move it later.

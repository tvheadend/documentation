# About

Tvheadend documentation is authored and maintained by Tvheadend users. If you see something is incorrect or missing please click the GitBook link below to join our documentation team. The GitBook online app makes changing documentation simple, with changes sent directly to our documentation repo on GitHub as a pull-request that project staff can review and merge.

> Please do not be concerned about your English language skills when contributing changes to our documentation. It is easier for a native speaker to merge your content and then make corrections than to write everything themselves. And if there is no obvious place to put content (the current structure is sparse and incomplete) please create pages under the [WIP](broken-reference) section. It can be merged and moved later as the documentation structure evolves.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains two types of documentation:

1. **User Documentation** - General guides, tutorials, and reference material for Tvheadend users (main sections in SUMMARY.md)

2. **WebUI In-App Help** - The `webui/` directory contains 131 markdown files that provide contextual help within the Tvheadend web interface. These files were migrated from the main tvheadend repository to centralize all documentation. See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for details.
